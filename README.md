A collection of coursework and independent projects that reflect my journey as a developer and cybersecurity enthusiast. Highlights include a Java-based Tic Tac Toe game exploring recursion and user input, and a Python honeypot designed to simulate network services, capture unauthorized access attempts, and log activity for basic threat analysis.
